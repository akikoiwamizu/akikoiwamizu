<!--
This single file sits directly under .github/ (not in a folder).
GitHub automatically applies it to every new Pull Request.
If you ever want multiple PR templates, you can make a subfolder
called .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/ — but then you’d have to
manually pick one via URL each time, which is unnecessary for solo projects.
