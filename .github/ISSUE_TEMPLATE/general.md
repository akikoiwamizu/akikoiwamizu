<!--
This file lives in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ because GitHub
expects issue templates to be stored inside that subfolder.
Each file here can define a separate issue type (bug, docs, feature, etc.)
and must include YAML front matter (the --- block below)
so that GitHub displays it in the “New Issue” menu.
