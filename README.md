# Hi, I'm Akiko Iwamizu

I am an Engineering Manager and Technical Director focused on data platforms, full-stack systems, and cloud infrastructure.

I have led multi-disciplinary teams that build scalable pipelines and APIs using GCP, Cloud Run, and modern data modeling frameworks. My work centers on building systems that are reliable, observable, and maintainable.

Most of my current projects are private under NDA, but below are representative public examples.
